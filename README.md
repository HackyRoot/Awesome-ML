Tips and tricks about Machine Learning.

- [GIF map](https://github.com/HackyRoot/Awesome-ML/blob/master/GIFmap/Maps_GIF.ipynb)

Tired of creating boring charts? Let's use some GIF power add animation to them.

- [GPU Test](https://github.com/HackyRoot/Awesome-ML/blob/master/GPU%20Test.ipynb)
    
    It tests how fast your GPU is compared to CPU in while doing ML stuff.
    
- [Histogram and Density Plots](https://github.com/HackyRoot/Awesome-ML/blob/master/Histogram_and_Density_Plot/Histogram%20and%20Density%20Plot.ipynb)

    Plotting histograms and density plots using real life [NYC flights dataset](https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13).
    
- [Python ANN](https://github.com/HackyRoot/Awesome-ML/blob/master/Python_ANN.ipynb)

    Deep learning is fun, but what's more fun? Creating artificial neural network from scratch just using Python.
